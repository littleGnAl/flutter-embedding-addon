/**
 * {@code Fragment} which displays a Flutter UI that takes up all available {@code Fragment} space.
 * <p>
 * Using a {@code FlutterFragment} requires forwarding a number of calls from an {@code Activity} to
 * ensure that the internal Flutter app behaves as expected:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #onPostResume()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #onBackPressed()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #onRequestPermissionsResult(int, String[], int[])} ()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #onNewIntent(Intent)} ()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #onUserLeaveHint()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #onTrimMemory(int)}</li>
 * </ol>
 * Additionally, when starting an {@code Activity} for a result from this {@code Fragment}, be sure
 * to invoke {@link Fragment#startActivityForResult(Intent, int)} rather than
 * {@link android.app.Activity#startActivityForResult(Intent, int)}. If the {@code Activity} version
 * of the method is invoked then this {@code Fragment} will never receive its
 * {@link Fragment#onActivityResult(int, int, Intent)} callback.
 * <p>
 * If convenient, consider using a {@link FlutterActivity} instead of a {@code FlutterFragment} to
 * avoid the work of forwarding calls.
 * <p>
 * {@code FlutterFragment} supports the use of an existing, cached {@link FlutterEngine}. To use a
 * cached {@link FlutterEngine}, ensure that the {@link FlutterEngine} is stored in
 * {@link FlutterEngineCache} and then use {@link #withCachedEngine(String)} to build a
 * {@code FlutterFragment} with the cached {@link FlutterEngine}'s ID.
 * <p>
 * It is generally recommended to use a cached {@link FlutterEngine} to avoid a momentary delay
 * when initializing a new {@link FlutterEngine}. The two exceptions to using a cached
 * {@link FlutterEngine} are:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>When {@code FlutterFragment} is in the first {@code Activity} displayed by the app, because
 *   pre-warming a {@link FlutterEngine} would have no impact in this situation.</li>
 *   <li>When you are unsure when/if you will need to display a Flutter experience.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The following illustrates how to pre-warm and cache a {@link FlutterEngine}:
 * <p>
 * {@code
 *   // Create and pre-warm a FlutterEngine.
 *   FlutterEngine flutterEngine = new FlutterEngine(context);
 *   flutterEngine
 *     .getDartExecutor()
 *     .executeDartEntrypoint(DartEntrypoint.createDefault());
 *
 *   // Cache the pre-warmed FlutterEngine in the FlutterEngineCache.
 *   FlutterEngineCache.getInstance().put("my_engine", flutterEngine);
 * }
 * <p>
 * If Flutter is needed in a location that can only use a {@code View}, consider using a
 * {@link FlutterView}. Using a {@link FlutterView} requires forwarding some calls from an
 * {@code Activity}, as well as forwarding lifecycle calls from an {@code Activity} or a
 * {@code Fragment}.

         * surrounding {@code Activity}, along with any plugins that are registered with that
         * {@link FlutterEngine}. This allows plugins to access the {@code Activity}, as well as
         * receive {@code Activity}-specific calls, e.g., {@link android.app.Activity#onNewIntent(Intent)}.
         * If {@code shouldAttachEngineToActivity} is false, then this {@code FlutterFragment} will not
         * automatically manage the connection between its {@link FlutterEngine} and the surrounding
         * {@code Activity}. The {@code Activity} will need to be manually connected to this
         * {@code FlutterFragment}'s {@link FlutterEngine} by the app developer. See
         * {@link FlutterEngine#getActivityControlSurface()}.
         * <p>
         * One reason that a developer might choose to manually manage the relationship between the
         * {@code Activity} and {@link FlutterEngine} is if the developer wants to move the
         * {@link FlutterEngine} somewhere else. For example, a developer might want the
         * {@link FlutterEngine} to outlive the surrounding {@code Activity} so that it can be used
         * later in a different {@code Activity}. To accomplish this, the {@link FlutterEngine} will
         * need to be disconnected from the surrounding {@code Activity} at an unusual time, preventing
         * this {@code FlutterFragment} from correctly managing the relationship between the
         * {@link FlutterEngine} and the surrounding {@code Activity}.
         * <p>
         * Another reason that a developer might choose to manually manage the relationship between the
         * {@code Activity} and {@link FlutterEngine} is if the developer wants to prevent, or explicitly
         * control when the {@link FlutterEngine}'s plugins have access to the surrounding {@code Activity}.
         * For example, imagine that this {@code FlutterFragment} only takes up part of the screen and
         * the app developer wants to ensure that none of the Flutter plugins are able to manipulate
         * the surrounding {@code Activity}. In this case, the developer would not want the
         * {@link FlutterEngine} to have access to the {@code Activity}, which can be accomplished by
